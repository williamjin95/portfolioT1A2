            Hi there! I'm William Jin, a 28-year-old diving into the world of coding. I'm brand new to this exciting field and eager to learn everything I can.
            I'm currently studying at Coder Academy, and I'm amazed by how much there is to discover. Outside of coding, you'll find me watching sports or gaming with mates.
            I may be new to coding, but I'm ready to tackle challenges head-on and see where this journey takes me. Let's explore the world of technology together!
