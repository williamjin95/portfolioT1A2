The purpose of portfolioT1A2 is to showcase the skills that I've learnt from the course and to start a new portfolio which I can add to as I learn more. The primary focus of this portfolio revolves around the motto 'keep it simple, stupid!' as I embark on my coding journey as a beginner. The goal is to reflect on this later and observe the progress and improvement I've made in the subject.
